# Stress Analyzer
This project analyzes and manages stress levels among students by evaluating parameters such as nervousness, emotional control, worry, trouble in relaxation, restlessness, irritability, and fear. Using these factors, it classifies stress levels into four categories: No Stress, Mild Stress, Moderate Stress, and Severe Stress. Based on the assessed stress level, the system provides personalized therapeutic recommendations, including music therapy through Spotify and book therapy, to help students manage and reduce their stress effectively. The project leverages data-driven methods and machine learning algorithms for analysis and includes a user-friendly interface for data input and result visualization. It integrates the Spotify API for fetching music recommendations and uses a database to store user data and stress assessment results. The goal is to enhance students' well-being and academic performance through targeted stress relief interventions.
